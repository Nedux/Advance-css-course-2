# Context
[Final product is deployed here](https://nedux.github.io/Advanced-css-course-project-2/)


Pure HTML + SASS + CSS grid based layout


Following along [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass).

**Â© Design by Jonas Schmedtmann**

# The process
- I was Doing everything by myself and then comparing the results to the tutorial.
- I was also taking notes on any solutions or hacks that might be new to me.
- Since this was the second practise webpage in the tutorial, I used the original solution just like I would use Figma design. 
- Thus, I only opened the code/tutorial after implementing a specific section by myself (**this can be seen in my commits**). 
- Also, since I was not blindly following the tutorial, I have improved some parts of the original design and overall responsiveness.
- Moreover, I have added some animations and other additional features that I feel would nicely fit in this project.


# Learnt lessons
- Practically implemented a bunch of the best practices using modern CSS grid.
- Learned how to put all svgs into one file (to minimize the amount of HTTP requests).
- Followed a desktop-first approach by finding places where the page "breaks" and adding media queries there.

# To run
`npm install`

`npm run start`
